# AVNetworkKit
A full networking layer implemented in Swift. 

Draws *heavy* inspiration from [HermesNetwork](https://github.com/malcommac/HermesNetwork), in fact most of the code is borrowed from there. Many thanks to [Daniele Margutti](https://github.com/malcommac) for the [article](http://danielemargutti.com/2017/09/09/network-layers-in-swift-updated/) that inspired this.

# Why AVNetworkKit?
While `HermesNetwork` uses `Promises` and many external dependencies, AVNetworkKit aims to use *none*.
